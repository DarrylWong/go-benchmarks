If you put it in the commit message here, that\u0027s fine, I\u0027ll include it in the README update I need to do myself (I have two changes pending, I am experimenting with link-order randomization and benchmark noise and your PGO option is timely).\n\nIf you\u0027re busy and see my own README updates land, feel free to do it there, later.",

I\u0027m not sure how the description of new the configurations should be put into the README file, so I added the information how to use it and why it was implemented in such way into the commit comment.
