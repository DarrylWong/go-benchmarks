If you put it in the commit message here, that\u0027s fine, I\u0027ll include it in the README update I need to do myself (I have two changes pending, I am experimenting with link-order randomization and benchmark noise and your PGO option is timely).\n\nIf you\u0027re busy and see my own README updates land, feel free to do it there, later.",
